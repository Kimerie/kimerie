## 💫 About Me

I’m a frontend engineer who loves building things that make sense to people and are clear, accessible, and grounded in real use.  
From enterprise UIs and clinician tools to little creative experiments, I care about how things work, how they feel, and who they're built for.  
I’m always learning, always iterating, and always aiming to create experiences that are empathetic, intuitive, and thoughtfully made.
